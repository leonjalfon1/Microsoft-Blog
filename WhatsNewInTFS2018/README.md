Last Wednesday 09/01/18 I gave a talk about the new features in TFS 2018 in Microsoft Raanana as part of the ALM User Group. 
In this talk we reviewed the new features and improvements introduced in TFS 2018, upgrade considerations and general Q&A
Many thanks to all for coming and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. If you have any questions, you know how to contact me.

See you next time,

Leon Jalfon
