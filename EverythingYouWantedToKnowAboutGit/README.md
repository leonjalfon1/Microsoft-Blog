Last Wednesday 15/03/17 I gave a talk about Git in Microsoft Raanana as part of the ALM User Group. People generally learn how to use Git but donâ€™t really understand it so this time the idea was to answer the most frequently asked questions, give a couple of tips and explain Git from another point of view.

Many thanks to all for coming and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. If you have any questions, you know how to contact me.

See you next time,

Leon Jalfon
